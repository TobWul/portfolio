        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Sanke is a service to help people in Oslo discover the potential of edible plants growing in parks and along the sidewalk. How to both use and find plants.
        I worked on this project during the summer in 2019 for Iterate. Our team consisted of me as a designer and two developers.</p>
        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>"How can Sanke help users use the potential of edible plants in Oslo".</p>
        When starting on this project, an MVP already existed. Our task was to test the MVP and expand its functionality to reach its goal.
        <h3>Users and audience</h3>
        <p>People interested in cooking<p>
        <h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Designer and frontend developer</p>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>We had six weeks to design and develop features published to the production app. Which features we were going to make was up to the summer intern team.</p>
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>We did not have access to real botanical data for the edible plants, so user testing was achieved with sample text written by us, botanical masters as we are.</p>
        <h2>Process and what I did</h2>
        <h3>What features can we develop to increase Sanke's value?</h3>
        <p>The old team focused on helping users learn a single plant and expand their knowledge from there. Our problem statement for the summer became: "From one plant to many".</p>
        <h3>User testing our first iteration</h3>
        <p>For this iteration, we created a map to browse all the plants in the database.
        In the user test, we expected to see if the map worked or not. But our warm-up questions about cooking and their relationship to edible wild plants revealed a new problem. People aren't interested in gathering edible plants. The main issues were: "What can I use the plants for?" and "Isn't the plants dirty with dog urine and car exhaust?".</p>
        <h3>How to motivate users to gather?</h3>
        <p>The user-test results lead to two new solutions to help motivate users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recipes – Solves: "What can I use the plants for?"</li>
            <li>Video – A short four-part video sequence to illustrate how a typical gathering trip looks. If a user can see how easy it is, it's easier for them to picture themselves doing it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The solutions are created based on qualitative user data, but it's hard to know how efficient the motivation is without real-use data.</p>
        <h3>How helpful is Sanke while gathering?</h3>
        <p>After motivating users to go out and gather plants, we have to make sure they can find what they're looking for, otherwise, Sanke would only bring disappointment, and lower retention.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display all plants in the current area – There's a lot of edible plants, but it's hard to know all of them. Displaying all plants in the same area as the user gives him/her a higher chance of finding something.</li>
            <li>Step by step identification – Images with the plants most important characteristics increases confidence when deciding whether it's the correct plant or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Outcomes and lessons</h3>
        <p>In the projects early phase, everyone on the team took part in a Google Sprint like design process with research, ideation, prototype and testing, no coding.
        After our initial concept phase, my role changed to a mix of design and development. I wore my design hat before lunch, doing mockups and user tests, and changed to my coding hat after lunch, implementing features and fixes.</p>
